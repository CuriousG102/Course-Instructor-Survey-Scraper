This framework was created for the purposes of creating spreadsheets for upload to the profsUT app. However, it has applications beyond this app. For example: Creating a report on class/instructor quality trends at the University of Texas. I do not intend to restrict its use and if you require any help in setting up this application (including me putting up a license) feel free to reach out to me via email at mileshutson@utexas.edu
